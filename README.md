# ABC News Stumble!
A new way to get the news.

1. Firefox is recommended. Simply [click the Firefox (.xpi)](https://github.com/phocks/abc-stumble/releases/download/1.0.2/abc_stumble-1.0.2-an+fx.xpi) and accept to install.
2. Also works on Chrome, but Google made it a pain in the ass to install without giving them money. [Download](https://github.com/phocks/abc-stumble/releases) the Chrome (.crx), open the extensions `chrome://extensions` window first and enable developer mode (switch up top right), and then drag the file on to your browser and accept the warnings to install.
3. Hit the ABC Logo to get the NEWS!
4. The browser extension will periodically gather the latest articles for you. So click again later, and enjoy!
