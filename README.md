# ABC News Stumble!
A new way to get the news.

1. Firefox is recommended. Simply [click the Firefox (.xpi)](https://github.com/phocks/abc-stumble/releases/download/1.0.0/abc_stumble-1.0.0-fx.xpi) and accept to install.
2. Also works on Chrome, but Google made it a pain in the ASS to install without giving them money. [Download](https://github.com/phocks/abc-stumble/releases) the Chrome (.crx) and then drag the file on to your browser (in Chrome open the extensions `chrome://extensions` window first and enable developer mode) and accept the warnings to install.
3. Hit the ABC Logo a few times to get the NEWS!
